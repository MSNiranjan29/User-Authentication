# User-Authentication
The project is structured into frontend and backend directories, with each containing the respective codebase. The frontend directory houses the React.js application, including components, routes, and assets. The backend directory contains the Node.js and Express.js server code, along with database configurations and API routes.
Project Description:

This project is a user authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a simple yet effective way for users to register, log in, view their profile, and log out securely. The primary objectives of the system are to ensure user data privacy, secure authentication mechanisms, and an intuitive user experience.

Key Features:

User Registration: Users can create a new account by providing a username, email, and password. The system implements basic form validation to ensure all required fields are filled, and the email format is valid. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password. Session-based authentication manages user sessions securely, allowing users to access protected routes and their profile information.

User Profile Page: Upon successful login, users are redirected to a profile page displaying their username and email. This page is accessible only to logged-in users and serves as a personalized dashboard for users to manage their account details.

Logout Functionality: Users have the option to log out, which effectively ends their session and prevents unauthorized access to their account. This feature ensures the security of user sessions and protects user data from unauthorized access.

Frontend Implementation: The frontend of the application is built using React.js, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different views and components.

Backend API: The backend API is developed using Node.js and Express.js, providing robust server-side functionality for handling user authentication requests. MongoDB with Mongoose is used as the database to store user data securely.

Error Handling: The system implements proper error handling mechanisms in both the frontend and backend to gracefully handle scenarios such as user already exists, incorrect password, or any other unexpected errors.

Security Measures: Best practices for security and data protection are followed throughout the project. This includes secure password hashing, session management, and securing API routes that require authentication to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Project Structure:

The project is structured into frontend and backend directories, with each containing the respective codebase. The frontend directory houses the React.js application, including components, routes, and assets. The backend directory contains the Node.js and Express.js server code, along with database configurations and API routes.

Conclusion:

The user authentication system provides a comprehensive solution for managing user accounts and ensuring secure access to protected resources. By leveraging the MERN stack and adhering to best practices for security and user experience, the system offers a robust and reliable authentication mechanism for web applications.
